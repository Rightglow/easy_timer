# Easy Timer

## Target

To finish a manual timer. This tool should be able to create new events and each one can be start and pause by ui button. When event A is paused, event B is stiil able to be restart.As a reslut, the user can manual record total time for each event with no conflicts. What's more, it should record every action for each event so the user can understand how does the event proceed.

Use PyQt5 to finish the GUI and json to save data.
